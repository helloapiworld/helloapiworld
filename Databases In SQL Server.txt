<ul id="Database"></ul>
<strong>Databases:</strong> Database is made of collections of objects such as tables, views, functions and stored procedures to stores the data in structured format .In database, objects having groups called schemas. Default schema is dbo in SQL Server . Databases are stored in the file system in files. Files can be grouped into filegroups. By default each database having two files one is data file and  another one is log file.Database are divided into two types

1.System Databases

2.User-Defined Databases

<strong>1.System Databases: </strong>Databases which are defined by Microsoft.

<strong>master Database: </strong>The master database stores all the system-level information like the location of other database database files, instance-wide metadata such as logon accounts, endpoints, linked servers, and system configuration settings. SQL Server cannot start if the master database is unavailable.

<strong>msdb Database:</strong> The msdb database is used by SQL Server Agent for scheduling alerts and jobs and by other features such as SQL Server Management Studio, Service Broker and Database Mail.By default, msdb uses the simple recovery model.

<strong>model Database:</strong> The model database is used as the template for all databases created on an instance of SQL Server. If you modify the model database, all databases created afterward will inherit those changes.

<strong>tempdb Database:</strong> The tempdb database is used to create temporary user objects that are explicitly created, such as: global or local temporary tables, temporary stored procedures, table variables, or cursors , holds the row versions that are generated by data modification transactions in a database. The tempdb is re-created every time SQL Server is started, model database is used for creating a new tempdb during start up. Improve the performance of tempdb by creating the number of secondary data files equal to number of logical cores on machine .

<strong>Resource Database:</strong> The Resource database is a read-only database that contains all the system objects that are included with SQL Server. SQL Server system objects, such as sys.objects, are physically persisted in the Resource database, but they logically appear in the sys schema of every database.

<strong>Operations Cannot Be Performed On System Databases:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Dropping the database.</li>
 	<li>Changing collation. The default collation is the server collation.</li>
 	<li>Removing the primary filegroup, primary data file, or log file.</li>
 	<li>Renaming the database or primary filegroup.</li>
 	<li>Dropping the guest user from the database.</li>
 	<li>Participating in database mirroring.</li>
 	<li>Enabling change data capture.</li>
 	<li>Setting the database or primary filegroup to READ_ONLY.</li>
 	<li>Setting the database to OFFLINE.</li>
</ul>
2.<strong>User-Defined Databases:</strong>Databases which are created by the user .

<strong><span style="color: red;">Syntax:</span></strong> <span style="color: blue;">CREATE  DATABASE  </span>[Database_Name]
<strong><span style="color: red;">Example:</span></strong> <span style="color: blue;">CREATE  DATABASE  </span>[dbShiksha]

<strong>Database Guidelines:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>SQL Server services should be set to start automatically .</li>
 	<li>Databases should be named appropriately to the application in which it is supporting .</li>
 	<li>Try to avoid creating object name as same as database name .</li>
 	<li>String fields should not have the word ‘Number’ in the name.</li>
 	<li>Avoid the use of reserved keywords for columns or objects.</li>
 	<li>The first letter of every word will be capitalized.</li>
 	<li>Words will be separated by an underscore.</li>
 	<li>Use some prefix while creating objects like
View              :  vk_&lt;&lt;View_Name&gt;&gt;
Procedure      : proc_&lt;&lt;&gt;Procedure_Name&gt;
Function        : udf_&lt;&lt;Function_Name&gt;&gt;
Trigger           : trg_&lt;&lt;Trigger_Name&gt;&gt;
Primary Key   : pk_&lt;&lt;Key_Name&gt;&gt;
Foreign Key   : fk_&lt;&lt;Key_Name&gt;&gt;
Index             : ix_&lt;&lt;index_name&gt;&gt;</li>
 	<li>Schema should be all lowercase, words separated by underscores and length should be less than 10 characters .</li>
 	<li>Use truncate instead of delete while deleting whole data .</li>
 	<li>Don't use nested stored procedures .</li>
 	<li>Using more temporary tables also will hamper the performance .</li>
</ul>
